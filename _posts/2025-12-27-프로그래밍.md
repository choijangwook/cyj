게임은 파이썬 코드로 작성되어 있습니다
실험과 변화를 위해 설계되었습니다. 여러 가지를 간소화한 버전입니다
고전 아케이드 게임이 포함되어 있습니다.

파이썬은 세계에서 가장 인기 있는 상위 5개 프로그래밍 언어 중 하나입니다
그리고 'Python.org <https://www.python.org/ >에서 무료로 이용할 수 있습니다. Python
설치와 함께 배포된 광범위한 표준 라이브러리가 포함되어 있습니다
표준 도서관에는 거북이라는 모듈이 있는데, 이는 인기 있는 소개 방법입니다
아이들을 위한 프로그래밍. 터틀은 원래 로고 프로그래밍 언어의 일부였습니다
1966년 월리 포어치히와 시모어 파퍼트가 개발했습니다. 모든 게임은 다음과 같습니다
'프리 파이썬 게임'_는 파이썬과 그 터틀 모듈을 사용하여 구현됩니다.

2012년부터 방과 후 프로그램으로 '프리 파이썬 게임'_이 시작되었습니다
도심 청소년들에게 프로그래밍을 가르칩니다. 목표는 그 만큼 재미있게 하는 것이었습니다
배우기 위해서였습니다. 그 이후로 게임들은 다양한 분야에서 개선되고 사용되었습니다
교실부터 여름날까지 다양한 환경 - camps.

게임은 데스크톱 컴퓨터를 포함한 파이썬을 설치할 수 있는 모든 곳에서 실행됩니다

게임을 통해 암호화 및 발사체 움직임과 같은 주제에 대해 배우기.

각 게임은 다른 게임과 완전히 독립적이며 다음과 같은 댓글을 포함합니다
학생들과 함께 해결해야 할 연습 문제 목록과 함께. 창의성과
유연성은 중요합니다. 새로운 것을 구현하는 옳고 그름의 방법은 없습니다

Quickstart
----------

Installing Free Python Games is simple with `pip
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`_::

  $ python3 -m pip install freegames

Free Python Games supports a command-line interface (CLI). Help for the CLI is
available using::

  $ python3 -m freegames --help

The CLI supports three commands: list, copy, and show. For a list of all games
run::

  $ python3 -m freegames list

Any of the listed games may be played by executing the Python module from the
command-line. To reference the Python module, combine "freegames" with the name
of the game. For example, to play the "snake" game run::

  $ python3 -m freegames.snake

Games can be modified by copying their source code. The copy command will
create a Python file in your local directory which you can edit. For example,
to copy and play the "snake" game run::

  $ python3 -m freegames copy snake
  $ python3 snake.py

Python includes a built-in text editor named IDLE which can also execute Python
code. To launch the editor and make changes to the "snake" game run::

  $ python3 -m idlelib.idle snake.py

You can also access documentation in the interpreter with Python's built-in
help function::

  >>> import freegames
  >>> help(freegames)

Free Python Games also provides an entry-point script for compatibility with
`pipx <https://pypa.github.io/pipx/>`_::

  $ pipx install freegames
  $ freegames play life
